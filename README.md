Choosing anything type of moving except wheels and tank tracks  

Сome up with an original way to destroy a balloon by a robot

**Originality in this task is higher than the efficiency of the method of movement**  

## Preferred type of robot  

Snake-like  

## Inspiring ideas   

## My ideas  

The movement of our robot will be based on rotation, so I need to choose ways of moving that can be implemented using rotational elements  

**pull-up links**  

the problem of increasing support for the segment opposite to movement can be solved with the help of automatically extending legs underneath it

**walking cylinders/ rocker arm**  

vertical rotational movement of the cylinders, which can be combined with forward movement due to increased amplitude. I imagine the implementation of this, by using a motor closer to the opposite to the amplitude link itself, in order to use the lever principle

**hidden wheels**  

parts of the segments will be “hidden wheels”, which will be hidden from external eyes by covering the body. the movement of each of them will be directed diagonally forward, but in the opposite direction.  with the help of translational rotation of these links, it will seem as if a real snake is moving. 

At the moment this idea seems less interesting to me, since it is more an example of a trick than the implementation of an interesting type of movement. If I fail to implement other methods in the allotted time and the teacher allows me, I will use it to meet the deadline.

I could hide the rotational elements with an amorphous body - from the outside it might look like muscle movement, so it would look like a real snake. 
if I figure out how to do this, it can be implemented using a special coating job. it comes to my mind to create a coating from a combination of reinforcement made of artificial fabric with wide cells, into which a 3D printing matrix will be imprinted.  

So far I understand a little how to combine these 2 materials, but if you need to make the resulting material elastic enough, a problem will arise. Perhaps I can solve it using a special printed matrix structure or the use of special materials - for example, TPU. At the moment I have no experience using this material. The task may probably turn out to be more labor-intensive than it looks now and I need a plan B  

**crayfish**  

I saw a snowplow collecting snow and filmed it on video, as I was interested in the mechanism of the paws with which the machine captured snow. It reminds me of the movement of a huge arthropod. if we add to this the principle of "walking cylinders", which I described above, then this can be used as a mechanism for moving my robot
