## Requirements  

Go through special track

Choosing anything type of moving except wheels and tank tracks  

Ð¡ome up with an original way to destroy a balloon by a robot

**Originality in this task is higher than the efficiency of the method of movement**  

## Preferred type of robot  

Snake-like  

## Inspiring ideas   

## My ideas  

The movement of our robot will be based on rotation, so I need to choose ways of moving that can be implemented using rotational elements

I could hide the rotational elements with an amorphous body - from the outside it might look like muscle movement, so it would look like a real snake. 
if I figure out how to do this, it can be implemented using a special coating job. it comes to my mind to create a coating from a combination of reinforcement made of artificial fabric with wide cells, into which a 3D printing matrix will be imprinted.  

So far I understand a little how to combine these 2 materials, but if you need to make the resulting material elastic enough, a problem will arise. Perhaps I can solve it using a special printed matrix structure or the use of special materials - for example, TPU. At the moment I have no experience using this material. The task may probably turn out to be more labor-intensive than it looks now and I need a plan B
